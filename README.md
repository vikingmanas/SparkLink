## 🌍 About SparkLink

**SparkLink** is an offline-first social utility app created for the **Swift Student Challenge 2026**.

University life can feel isolating — especially when you're searching for a safe and supportive community.

SparkLink helps students discover their **“Found Family”** by enabling secure, anonymous connections within a localized campus space — without ever sending data to the internet.

Everything happens:

📱 On-device  
📡 Locally  
🔒 Privately  

Your identity stays yours.

---

## 🛡️ Core Philosophy

SparkLink is built on three pillars:

- **Privacy by Design**
- **Safety by Default**
- **Connection without Exposure**

No servers.  
No accounts.  
No tracking.  

Just meaningful, safe proximity-based interaction.
